# Welcome to Projet ASE ESIR 3

Welcome to our Robot DSL Project, a domain-specific language designed for programming robotic appliances, with a focus on the Roomba robotic vacuum cleaner. This project aims to simplify and streamline the process of programming robots by providing a language close to the problem domain.

For a more comprehensive and detailed description of the entire project, including its architecture, usage, and development, please visit the [LangiumProject](https://github.com/ASE-ESIR3/langiumProject) repository.

## Our Projects

### [RobotML](https://github.com/ASE-ESIR3/RobotML)
- **Description**: RobotML is our repository dedicated to Ecore modeling. We utilize Ecore model to generate the xText and work towards Langium.
- **Technologies Used**: Ecore, Xtext, Langium. 

### [LangiumProject](https://github.com/ASE-ESIR3/langiumProject) (main repo)
- **Description**: Stemming from our work on RobotML, LangiumProject is the project generated from xText.
- **Technologies Used**: Langium, xText.

### [CodeTests](https://github.com/ASE-ESIR3/CodeTests)
- **Description**: CodeTests is a collection of tests for our own language. It serves as validation and demonstration of the capabilities of our developed specific language.
- **Technologies Used**: Specific language developed.
